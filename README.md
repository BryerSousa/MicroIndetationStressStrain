# MicroIndetationStressStrain
This repository contains the codes, and a representative data set to trouble shoot, to extract the indentation stress strain data from time-load-displacement data with or without an image of the post-deformed sample surface.


The code and data are associated with the description and results presented in the following paper. Though the code is publically available for use, the authors ask that you utilize proper citiation format when utilized.
